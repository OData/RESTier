RESTier supports various ways to build EDM model. Users may first get an initial model from the EF provider. Then RESTier's `RestierModelExtender` can further extend the model with additional entity sets, singletons and operations from the public properties and methods defined in the `Api` class. This subsection mainly talks about how to build an initial EDM model and then the convention RESTier adopts to extend an EDM model from an `Api` class.

### Build an initial EDM model
The `RestierModelExtender` requires EDM types to be present in the initial model because it is only responsible for building entity sets, singletons and operations **NOT types**. So anyway users need to build an initial EDM model with adequate types added in advance. The typical way to do so is to write a custom model builder implementing `IModelBuilder` and register it to the `Api` class. Here is an example using the [`**ODataConventionModelBuilder**`](http://odata.github.io/WebApi/#02-04-convention-model-builder) in OData Web API to build an initial model only containing the `Person` type.
Any model building methods supported by Web API OData can be used here, refer to **[Web API OData Model builder ](http://odata.github.io/WebApi/#02-01-model-builder-abstract)**document for more information.

    {
        protected override IServiceCollection ConfigureApi(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddService<IModelBuilder, CustomizedModelBuilder>();
            return base.ConfigureApi(services);
        }

        private class CustomizedModelBuilder : IModelBuilder
        {
            public Task<IEdmModel> GetModelAsync(InvocationContext context, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
            {
                var builder = new ODataConventionModelBuilder();
                builder.EntityType<Person>();
                return Task.FromResult(builder.GetEdmModel());
            }
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

If RESTier entity framework provider is used and user has no additional types other than those in the database schema, no custom model builder or even the `Api` class is required because the provider will take over to build the model instead. But what the provider does behind the scene is similar.
With entity framework provider, the model by default is built with [**ODataConventionModelBuilder**](http://odata.github.io/WebApi/#02-04-convention-model-builder), refer to [document](http://odata.github.io/WebApi/#02-04-convention-model-builder) on the conversions been used like how the builder identifies keys for entity type and so on. 

### Extend a model from Api class
The `RestierModelExtender` will further extend the EDM model passed in using the public properties and methods defined in the `Api` class. Please note that all properties and methods declared in the parent classes are **NOT** considered.

**Entity set**
If a property declared in the `Api` class satisfies the following conditions, an entity set whose name is the property name will be added into the model.

 - Public
 - Has getter
 - Either static or instance
 - There is no existing entity set with the same name
 - Return type must be `IQueryable<T>` where `T` is class type

Example:

{% highlight csharp %}
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using Microsoft.Restier.Core.Model;
using Microsoft.Restier.Provider.EntityFramework;
using Microsoft.OData.Service.Sample.Trippin.Models;

namespace Microsoft.OData.Service.Sample.Trippin.Api
{
    public class TrippinApi : EntityFrameworkApi<TrippinModel>
    {
        public IQueryable<Person> PeopleWithFriends
        {
            get { return Context.People.Include("Friends"); }
        }
        ...
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
<br/>
 
**Singleton**
If a property declared in the `Api` class satisfies the following conditions, a singleton whose name is the property name will be added into the model.

 - Public
 - Has getter
 - Either static or instance
 - There is no existing singleton with the same name
 - Return type must be non-generic class type

Example:

{% highlight csharp %}
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using Microsoft.Restier.Core.Model;
using Microsoft.Restier.Provider.EntityFramework;
using Microsoft.OData.Service.Sample.Trippin.Models;

namespace Microsoft.OData.Service.Sample.Trippin.Api
{
    public class TrippinApi : EntityFrameworkApi<TrippinModel>
    {
        ...
        public Person Me { get { return DbContext.People.Find(1); } }
        ...
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Due to some limitations from Entity Framework and OData spec, CUD (insertion, update and deletion) on the singleton entity are **NOT** supported directly by RESTier. Users need to define their own route to achieve these operations.

**Navigation property binding**
Starting from version 0.5.0, the `RestierModelExtender` follows the rules below to add navigation property bindings after entity sets and singletons have been built.

 - Bindings will **ONLY** be added for those entity sets and singletons that have been built inside `RestierModelExtender`.
   **Example:** Entity sets built by the RESTier's EF provider are assumed to have their navigation property bindings added already.
 - The `RestierModelExtender` only searches navigation sources who have the same entity type as the source navigation property.
   **Example:** If the type of a navigation property is `Person` or `Collection(Person)`, only those entity sets and singletons of type `Person` are searched.
 - Singleton navigation properties can be bound to either entity sets or singletons. 
   **Example:** If `Person.BestFriend` is a singleton navigation property, bindings from `BestFriend` to an entity set `People` or to a singleton `Boss` are all allowed.
 - Collection navigation properties can **ONLY** be bound to entity sets.
   **Example:** If `Person.Friends` is a collection navigation property. **ONLY** binding from `Friends` to an entity set `People` is allowed. Binding from `Friends` to a singleton `Boss` is **NOT** allowed.
 - If there is any ambiguity among entity sets or singletons, no binding will be added.
   **Example:** For the singleton navigation property `Person.BestFriend`, no binding will be added if 1) there are at least two entity sets (or singletons) both of type `Person`; 2) there is at least one entity set and one singleton both of type `Person`. However for the collection navigation property `Person.Friends`, no binding will be added only if there are at least two entity sets both of type `Person`. One entity set and one singleton both of type `Person` will **NOT** lead to any ambiguity and one binding to the entity set will be added.

If any expected navigation property binding is not added by RESTier, users can always manually add it through custom model extension (mentioned below).
<br/>

**Operation**
If a method declared in the `Api` class satisfies the following conditions, an operation whose name is the method name will be added into the model.

 - Public
 - Either static or instance
 - There is no existing operation with the same name

Example:

{% highlight csharp %}
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using Microsoft.Restier.Core.Model;
using Microsoft.Restier.Provider.EntityFramework;
using Microsoft.OData.Service.Sample.Trippin.Models;

namespace Microsoft.OData.Service.Sample.Trippin.Api
{
    public class TrippinApi : EntityFrameworkApi<TrippinModel>
    {
        ...
        // Action import
        [Operation(Namespace = "Microsoft.OData.Service.Sample.Trippin.Models", HasSideEffects = true)]
        public void CleanUpExpiredTrips() {}
        
        // Bound action
        [Operation(Namespace = "Microsoft.OData.Service.Sample.Trippin.Models", IsBound = true, HasSideEffects = true)]
        public Trip EndTrip(Trip bindingParameter) { ... }
        
        // Function import
        [Operation(Namespace = "Microsoft.OData.Service.Sample.Trippin.Models", EntitySet = "People")]
        public IEnumerable<Person> GetPeopleWithFriendsAtLeast(int n) { ... }
        
        // Bound function
        [Operation(Namespace = "Microsoft.OData.Service.Sample.Trippin.Models", IsBound = true, EntitySet = "People")]
        public Person GetPersonWithMostFriends(IEnumerable<Person> bindingParameter) { ... }
        ...
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Note:

1. Operation attribute's EntitySet property is needed if there are more than one entity set of the entity type that is type of result defined. Take an example if two EntitySet People and AllPersons are defined whose entity type is Person, and the function returns Person or List of Person, then the Operation attribute for function must have EntitySet defined, or EntitySet property is optional. 


2. Function and Action uses the same attribute, and if the method is an action, must specify property HasSideEffects with value of true whose default value is false.


3. Starting from version 0.6, the operation namespace will be same as the entity type by default if it is not specified, if the namespace is specified in operation attribute, then that namespaces in attribute will be used.  Also in order to support operation bound to type like complex type/primitive type besides the entity type, IsBound flag must be set to true for bound operation.


4. Starting from version 0.6, operation will be auto routed to method defined in Api class, no additional controller is needed. Refer to [section 3.3](http://odata.github.io/RESTier/v0.6/#03-03-Operation) for more information.

### Custom model extension
If users have the need to extend the model even after RESTier's conventions have been applied, user can use IServiceCollection AddService to add a ModelBuilder after calling base.ConfigureApi(services).

{% highlight csharp %}
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.OData.Edm;
using Microsoft.Restier.Core;
using Microsoft.Restier.Core.Model;
using Microsoft.Restier.Provider.EntityFramework;
using Microsoft.OData.Service.Sample.Trippin.Models;

namespace Microsoft.OData.Service.Sample.Trippin.Api
{
    public class TrippinAttribute : ApiConfiguratorAttribute
    {
        protected override IServiceCollection ConfigureApi(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services = base.ConfigureApi(services);

            // Add your custom model extender here.
            services.AddService<IModelBuilder, CustomizedModelBuilder>();
            return services;
        }

        private class CustomizedModelBuilder : IModelBuilder
        {
            public IModelBuilder InnerModelBuilder { get; set; }

            public async Task<IEdmModel> GetModelAsync(InvocationContext context, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
            {
                IEdmModel model = null;
                
                // Call inner model builder to get a model to extend.
                if (this.InnerModelBuilder != null)
                {
                    model = await this.InnerModelBuilder.GetModelAsync(context, cancellationToken);
                }

                // Do sth to extend the model such as add custom navigation property binding.

                return model;
            }
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}


After the above steps, the final process of building the model will be:

 - User's model builder registered before base.ConfigureApi(services) is called first.
 - RESTier's model builder includes EF model builder and RestierModelExtender will be called.
 - User's model builder registered after base.ConfigureApi(services) is called.
 <br/>
 
If InnerModelBuilder method is not called first, then the calling sequence will be different.
Actually this order not only applies to the `IModelBuilder` but also all other services.

Refer to [section 4.3](http://odata.github.io/RESTier/v0.6/#04-03-Api-Service) for more details of RESTier API Service.
