## What is Restier?

Restier is an API development framework for building standardized, **OData V4 based RESTful services** on .NET.

Restier is the spiritual successor to [WCF Data Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WCF_Data_Services). Instead of generating endless boilerplate code with the current Web API + OData toolchain, RESTier helps you bootstrap a standardized, queryable HTTP-based REST interface in literally minutes.

<Info>
Like WCF Data Services before it, Restier provides simple and straightforward ways to shape queries and intercept submissions **before** and **after** they hit the database. And like Web API + OData, you still have the flexibility to add your own custom queries and actions with techniques you're already familiar with.
</Info>

## What is OData?

**OData** stands for the Open Data Protocol. OData enables the creation and consumption of RESTful APIs, which allow resources, defined in a data model and identified by using URLs, to be published and edited by Web clients using simple HTTP requests.

<Note>
OData was originally designed by Microsoft to be a framework for exposing Entity Framework objects over REST services. The first concepts shipped as "Project Astoria" in 2007. By 2009, the concept had evolved enough for Microsoft to announce OData, along with a [larger effort](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/odatateam/2009/11/17/breaking-down-data-silos-the-open-data-protocol-odata/) to push the format as an industry standard.
</Note>

Work on the current version of the protocol (V4) began in April 2012, and was ratified by OASIS as an industry standard in February 2014.

## Getting Started

Now that the project has restarted, we have a new location for our [Continuous Integration builds][nightly-feed]. We've simplified the NuGet packages as well, so now you can just reference the following packages and we'll take care of the rest:

<CodeGroup>

```bash ASP.NET
dotnet add package Microsoft.Restier.AspNet
```

```bash ASP.NET Core
dotnet add package Microsoft.Restier.AspNetCore
```

</CodeGroup>

## Use Cases

<Warning>
Coming Soon!
</Warning>

## Supported Platforms

<Tip>
Restier 1.0 currently ships with support for Classic ASP.NET 5.2.3 and later. Support for ASP.NET Core 2.2 is coming in the first half of 2019.
</Tip>

## Restier Components

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="ASP.NET">
    The Classic ASP.NET flavor of Restier is made up of the following components:

    - **Microsoft.Restier.AspNet:** Plugs into the OData/WebApi processing pipeline and provides query interception capabilities.
    - **Microsoft.Restier.Core:** The base library that contains the core convention-based interception framework.
    - **Microsoft.Restier.EntityFramework:** Translates intercepted queries down to the database level to be executed.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="ASP.NET Core">
    The ASP.NET Core flavor of Restier consists of the following:

    - **Microsoft.Restier.AspNetCore:** Plugs into the OData/WebApi processing pipeline and provides query interception capabilities.
