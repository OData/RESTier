### Test specification

All tests need to be written with **xUnit**. Here are some rules to follow when you are organizing the test code:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Project name correspondence" icon="folder">
    Format: `X -> X.Tests`

    For instance, all the test code of the `Microsoft.Restier.Core` project should be placed in the `Microsoft.Restier.Core.Tests` project.

    **Path and file name correspondence**: `X/Y/Z/A.cs -> X.Tests/Y/Z/ATests.cs`

    For example, the test code of the `ConventionBasedApiModelBuilder` class (in the `Microsoft.Restier.Core/Convention/ConventionBasedApiModelBuilder.cs` file) should be placed in the `Microsoft.Restier.Core.Tests/Convention/ConventionBasedApiModelBuilderTests.cs` file.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Namespace correspondence" icon="code">
    Format: `X.Tests/Y/Z -> X.Tests.Y.Z`

    The namespace of the file should strictly follow the path. For example, the namespace of the `ConventionBasedApiModelBuilderTests.cs` file should be `Microsoft.Restier.Core.Tests.Convention`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Utility classes" icon="wrench">
    The file for a utility class can be placed at the same level of its user or a shared level that is visible to all its users. But the file name must **NOT** end with `Tests` to avoid any confusion.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Integration and scenario tests" icon="flask">
    Those tests usually involve multiple modules and have some specific scenarios. They should be placed separately in `X.Tests/IntegrationTests` and `X.Tests/ScenarioTests`. There is no hard requirement of the folder structure for those tests. But they should be organized logically and systematically as possible.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
