# Welcome to RESTier!

RESTier is a RESTful API development framework for building standardized, OData V4 based RESTful services on .NET 
platform. It can be seen as a middle-ware on top of [**Web API OData**](http://odata.github.io/WebApi/). RESTier 
provides facilities to bootstrap an OData service like what WCF Data Services (which is sunset) does, beside this, 
it supports to add business logic in several simple steps, has flexibility and easy customization like what Web API 
OData do. It also supports to add additional publishers to support other protocols and additional providers to support
other data sources.

## What is OData?

OData stands for the Open Data Protocol. OData enables the creation and consumption of RESTful APIs, which allow 
resources, defined in a data model and identified by using URLs, to be published and edited by Web clients using 
simple HTTP requests.

## A Little History

OData was originally designed by Microsoft to be a considtent framework for exposing Entity Framework objects over HTTP.
It has since been submitted to and ratified by OASIS as an industry standard for building queryable APIs.
