## Pull Requests
**Pull request is the only way we accept code and document contribution.** Pull request of document, features 
and bug fixes are both welcomed. Refer to this [link](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) 
to learn details about pull request. Before you send a pull request to us, you need to make sure you've 
followed the steps listed below.

### Pick an issue to work on
You should either create or pick an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/OData/RESTier/issues) 
before you work on the pull request. After the RESTier team has reviewed this issue and change its label 
to "accepting pull request", you can work on the code change.

### Prepare Tools
[Atom](https://atom.io/) with package [atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify) and 
[markdown-toc](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-toc) is recommended to edit the document. 
[MarkdownPad](http://www.markdownpad.com/) can also be used to edit the document.<br />
Visual Studio 2015 is recommended for code contribution.

### Steps to create a pull request
These are the recommended steps to create a pull request:<br />

1. Create a forked repository of [https://github.com/OData/RESTier.git](https://github.com/OData/RESTier.git)
2. Clone the forked repository into your local environment
3. Add a git remote to upstream for local repository with command _git remote add upstream 
[https://github.com/OData/RESTier.git](https://github.com/OData/RESTier.git)_
4. Make code changes and add test cases, refer Test specification section for more details about test
5. Test the changed codes with one-click build and test script
6. Commit changed code to local repository with clear message
7. Rebase the code to upstream via command _git pull --rebase upstream master_ and resolve conflicts 
if there is any then continue rebase via command _git pull --rebase continue_
8. Push local commit to the forked repository
9. Create pull request from forked repository Web console via comparing with upstream.
10. Complete a Contributor License Agreement (CLA), refer below section for more details.
11. Pull request will be reviewed by Microsoft OData team
12. Address comments and revise code if necessary
13. Commit the changes to local repository or amend existing commit via command _git commit --amend_
14. Rebase the code with upstream again via command _git pull --rebase upstream master_ and resolve 
conflicts if there is any then continue rebase via command _git pull --rebase continue_
15. Test the changed codes with one-click build and test script again
16. Push changes to the forked repository and use _--force_ option if existing commit is amended
17. Microsoft OData team will merge the pull request into upstream

### Test specification
All tests need to be written with xUnit. Here are some rules to follow when you are organizing the 
test code:

- **Project name correspondence** (`X -> X.Tests`). For instance, all the test code of the `Microsoft.Restier.Core` project should be placed in the `Microsoft.Restier.Core.Tests` project. Path and file name correspondence. (`X/Y/Z/A.cs -> X.Tests/Y/Z/ATests.cs`). For example, the test code of the `ConventionBasedApiModelBuilder` class (in the `Microsoft.Restier.Core/Convention/ConventionBasedApiModelBuilder.cs` file) should be placed in the `Microsoft.Restier.Core.Tests/Convention/ConventionBasedApiModelBuilderTests.cs` file.
- **Namespace correspondence** (`X.Tests/Y/Z -> X.Tests.Y.Z`). The namespace of the file should strictly follow the path. For example, the namespace of the `ConventionBasedApiModelBuilderTests.cs` file should be `Microsoft.Restier.Core.Tests.Convention`.
- **Utility classes**. The file for a utility class can be placed at the same level of its user or a shared level that is visible to all its users. But the file name must **NOT** be ended with `Tests` to avoid any confusion.
- **Integration and scenario tests**. Those tests usually involve multiple modules and have some specific scenarios. They should be placed separately in `X.Tests/IntegrationTests` and `X.Tests/ScenarioTests`. There is no hard requirement of the folder structure for those tests. But they should be organized logically and systematically as possible.
