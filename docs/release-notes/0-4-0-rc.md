## New Features

 - Unified hook handler mechanism for users to inject hooks, [Tutorial](http://odata.github.io/RESTier/#04-04-Hook-Handler)
 - Built-in `RestierController` now handles most CRUD scenarios for users including entity set access, singleton access, entity access, property access with $count/$value, $count query option support. [#136](https://github.com/OData/RESTier/issues/136), [#193](https://github.com/OData/RESTier/issues/193), [#234](https://github.com/OData/RESTier/issues/234), [Tutorial](http://odata.github.io/RESTier/#03-05-Controllers)
 - Support building entity set, singleton and operation from `Api` (previously `Domain`). Support navigation property binding. Now users can save much time writing code to build model. [#207](https://github.com/OData/RESTier/issues/207), [Tutorial](http://odata.github.io/RESTier/#02-06-Model-building)
 - Support in-memory data source provider [#189](https://github.com/OData/RESTier/issues/189)

## Enhancements

 - Thorough API cleanup, code refactor and concept reduction [#164](https://github.com/OData/RESTier/issues/164)
 - The Conventions project was merged into the Core project. Conventions are now enabled by default. The `OnModelExtending` convention was removed due to inconsistency. [#191](https://github.com/OData/RESTier/issues/191)
 - Add a sample service with an in-memory provider [#189](https://github.com/OData/RESTier/issues/189)
 - Unified exception-handling process [#24](https://github.com/OData/RESTier/issues/24), [#26](https://github.com/OData/RESTier/issues/26)
 - Simplified `MapRestierRoute` now takes an `Api` class instead of a controller class. No custom controller required in simple cases.
 - Update project URL in RESTier NuGet packages.
